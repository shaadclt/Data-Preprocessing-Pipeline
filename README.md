# Data Preprocessing Pipeline

This project contains a data preprocessing pipeline implemented in Python using the pandas and numpy libraries. The pipeline handles missing values, outliers, and normalizes numeric features in a dataset.

## What is a Data Preprocessing Pipeline?
Data Preprocessing involves transforming and manipulating raw data to improve its quality, consistency, and relevance for analysis. It encompasses several tasks, including handling missing values, standardizing variables, and removing outliers. By performing these preprocessing steps, data professionals ensure that subsequent analysis is based on reliable and accurate data, leading to better insights and predictions.

A data preprocessing pipeline is a systematic and automated approach that combines multiple preprocessing steps into a cohesive workflow. It serves as a roadmap for data professionals, guiding them through the transformations and calculations needed to cleanse and prepare data for analysis. The pipeline consists of interconnected steps, each of which is responsible for a specific preprocessing task, such as:

* Imputing missing values
* Scaling numeric features
* Finding and removing outliers
* Encoding categorical variables
By following the predefined sequence of operations, the pipeline ensures consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency in overall preprocessing steps.

## How a Data Preprocessing Pipeline Helps Data Professionals?
A Data Preprocessing pipeline is crucial to help various data science professionals, including data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers, in their respective roles.

For Data Engineers, the pipeline simplifies work by automating data transformation tasks, allowing them to focus on designing scalable data architectures and optimizing data pipelines.

Data Analysts benefit from the pipelineâ€™s ability to normalize and clean data, ensuring accuracy and reducing time spent on data cleaning tasks. It allows analysts to spend more time on exploratory data analysis and gaining meaningful insights.

On the other hand, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers rely on clean and well-preprocessed data for accurate predictive modelling and advanced analytics. The preprocessing pipeline automates repetitive preprocessing tasks, allowing them efficiently experiment and quickly iterate on their datasets.

## Installation

To use this pipeline, you need to have Python installed. You also need to install the following dependencies:

```shell
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To use the data preprocessing pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:
``` shell
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
2. Call the **data_preprocessing_pipeline** function with your dataset:
``` shell
# Load your dataset using pandas
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
preprocessed_data = data_preprocessing_pipeline(data)
```

3. The **preprocessed_data** variable now contains the preprocessed dataset.
